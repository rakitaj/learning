# Overview

## Definitions
ADT = Abstract Data Type
API = Application Programming Interface
Algorithm = Finite, deterministic, and effective problem-solving method suitable for implementation as a computer program
Analysis of algorithms = The branch of computer science dealing with choosing the best algorithm for a particular task
Graph = Set of objectss, possibly with weights and orientation

## Fundamental ADTs
1. Bag
2. Queue
3. Stack

Algorithms are mostly independent of the language being used. They are series of steps to take.

Implementing an algorithm is an important step of learning it. This is still true even though the C# and Java standard libs include easy access to sorting and search algorithms.
