### Definitions
Primitive data types = integer, real number, boolean, character aka int, double, bool, char
Strings = not primitive data type, a collection of characters
Data type = values and the set of operations on those values
Ragged arrayh = A 2D array where its arrays have different lengths
Matrix dot product =

There are machine specific characteristics of each data type 
- char = 16 bit character
- byte = 8 bit integer
- int = 32 bit integer
- long = 64 bit integer
- double = 64 bit real number
- many more...

### Recursion
Has a base case, this will return
Recursive calls must address subproblems that are smaller in some sense so recursive calls converge to the base case
The subproblems should not overlap
